 \begin{block}{Occam's razor}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Choose the simplest theory that explains experiment
   \item Physicist define \alert{simplest} as \alert{having most symmetries}
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Symmetries of the theory}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Theory contains at least all observed symmetries
   \item Additional asymmetries will be present in simplest theory
  \end{itemize}
 \end{block}
 \begin{block}{Broken symmetries}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item If some of the additional symmetries are later found to be broken in nature, the theory has to be modified
   \item \alert{New underlying mechanisms} to explain broken symmetries
  \end{itemize}
