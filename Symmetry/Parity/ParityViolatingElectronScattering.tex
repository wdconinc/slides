  \begin{itemize}
   \item Electrons strike a proton in a fixed hydrogen target
   \item \alert{Spin} of the electrons is \alert{alternated quickly}
   \item Detect the scattered electrons in an array of detectors
   \item Is there a difference between how many electrons we detect when is spin forward or spin backward?

 \begin{block}<+->{Precision measurements of parity violation}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Parity violation is \alert{a very small effect}
   \item Need to measure for a long time: months to years
   \item Everything else should remain stable during the experiment
   \item \alert{Measurement of the effects of $W$ and $Z$ bosons}
   \item \alert{Very sensitive to other, supersymmetric particles!}
